    <p>The marks  for the  course will  be distributed as  follows (note:  the instructors
    reserve the right to modify the marking scheme at any time, although the final marking
    scheme should be fairly close to that given here):

    </p><div style="margin-left: 20px;">
      <table class="btable">
          <tbody><tr> <td>Assignments (5)</td><td>30%</td></tr>
          <tr> <td>Take-home Tests (2)</td><td>20%</td></tr>
          <tr> <td>Midterm  </td><td>15%</td></tr>
          <tr> <td>Final Exam</td><td>30%</td></tr>
	  <tr> <td>Pre-class Quizzes</td><td>3%</td></tr>
	  <tr> <td>Tutorial Quizzes</td><td>2%</td></tr>
      </tbody></table>
    </div>

    <p><b>To pass the course, you must obtain at  least 50% of the weighted average of the
    tests, midterm and final exam, and at least 45% on the weighted average of the midterm
    and final exam.</b> Students who fail to  meet this requirement will receive at most a
    mark of 45% for the course, regardless of the results of the formula above.

    </p><p>Each  assignment  and each  pre-class  quiz  contributes  equal weight  toward  its
    respective average.
      
    </p><h3>Pre-class quizzes</h3>
      
    <p>Pre-class quizzes will be due online roughly weekly and be scaled to 2 points each,
    where your grade will be rounded up to the  next integer (so, 30% on a quiz would earn
    1/2, and 68% on  a quiz would earn 2/2). Your lowest two  pre-class quiz marks will be
    dropped. Because you can earn 100% even if you miss a quiz, we typically do not accept
    excuses for missed pre-class quizzes. That said,  if you have concerns, please talk to
    us!
    
    </p><h3>Tutorial quizzes</h3>

    <p>Tutorial quizzes will be written during the  second half of each tutorial, and will
    be graded based on apparent effort rather than correctness.

    </p><h3>Assignments</h3>

    <p>There  will be  5  written assignments  during  the term.  Some  of the  assignment
    questions will be related to the problems discussed in tutorials.
    
    </p><h3>Examinations</h3>

    <p>The two take-home  tests have been scheduled for <b>Wednesday,  October 5th</b> and
    <b>Wednesday, November 23rd</b>. Each test will  be available starting at 00:01 PDT on
    the given day, and must be submitted no later than 23:59 PDT on that same day.</p>
      
    <p>The midterm  has been scheduled for  <b>Thursday November 3rd at  19:00</b>. If you
    have a conflict  with the midterm time, you <b>must</b>  inform the course coordinator
    no later  than two weeks in  advance of the exam!  For evening midterm exams,  we will
    accept any  reasonable scheduling  conflict as  an excuse for  missing it.  Here's the
    boundary line  between unreasonable and  reasonable: if you  see tickets to  a concert
    during the exam  time that sounds pretty  cool after the term starts  (assuming such a
    concert is allowed to  go ahead), and we have already posted the  exam date, that's an
    unreasonable excuse.  But, if you already  bought tickets to that  pretty cool concert
    before the term started, that's a  reasonable excuse. That said, we strongly encourage
    you to  write the exam, as  accommodation may just involve  back-calculating a midterm
    grade for you from the final exam.

    </p><p>Do  not  write  an  exam  if  a medical  factor  might  significantly  impair  your
    performance. If you are  unable to write a test or the midterm  due to illness, inform
    the course  coordinator immediately, detailing the  period during which you  were ill,
    but do not present a doctor's note.  The course coordinator will establish and explain
    accommodation     at    that     time.    If     you    are     <a target="_parent" href="http://www.students.ubc.ca/coursesreg/exams/exam-policies-accommodations/">unable
    to write the final examination due to illness</a>, you must apply to your home faculty
    for                               <i><a target="_parent" href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,48,0,0">Academic
    Concession</a></i> as soon as possible.

    </p><p>In            accordance             with            <a target="_parent" href="http://www.universitycounsel.ubc.ca/policies/policy65.pdf">UBC  Policy  #65</a>,
    students who are scheduled to attend classes or write examinations on the holy days of
    their religion  must notify their  instructors two weeks  in advance of  the religious
    holiday they  wish to  observe. Instructors will  provide opportunity for  students to
    make up the missed work or examination without penalty.

    </p><h3>Course Policy on Review of Marking</h3>

    <p>Here is the procedure to follow if you wish to have an assigned mark reviewed:</p>
    <ol class="onormal">
      <li>You have <b>one week</b> from the time the grades are posted to submit a regrade
      request.</li>
	
      <p></p><li>You    should   submit    the   regrade    request   on    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gradescope.ca/">Gradescope</a>. Write a  note explaining precisely
      why you believe the grade you were given for that question was inappropriate.</li>
	  
      <p></p><li>The person who  graded the question will review your  request, generally with
      input from  other TAs or other  instructor involved in the  original marking. <b>The
      decision of your TA  or instructor is final.</b> It may  either increase or decrease
      the assigned mark based on the cited questions or other questions.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Note: Marking often involves some degree  of subjective judgment. When the assigned
    mark falls within the range deemed consistent with the marking scheme, your instructor
    will always respect  the judgment of the original marker.  This assures consistency in
    marking for all students.
